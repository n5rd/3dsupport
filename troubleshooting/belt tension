Belt tensioning can lead to issues from being overtensioned, but more frequently from being undertensioned.

A belt should be kept taught and should not sag or fall down under it's own weight, pushing on the belt should lead to feeling the tension. The belt should not be able to deform more than a centimeter with light/medium force.
